# Notifier

## Description 
    Notifier is a note taking app designed to easily and quickly add todo's and remove them for all of lifes chores.
    This was the first real experience I had using express to write back end code for a server base, and I learned
    very much. Things that challenged me creating this app were making successful GET routes as well as a DELETE
    so the app has functionality to remove notes when needed.

## Usage

Once on the notes page, you can type a title, then description of your note like seen here:

Then, click the little floppy disk in the top right corner to save that note, and you will see it appear on the left in the saved notes section.

Once the note needs to be deleted, (in our case we finished the dishes, cleaned the yard, vacuumed the floors and did the laundry) just click the little trash can next to the note you wish to delete.
